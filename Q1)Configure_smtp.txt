Q1. Configure smtp in localhost.

Soln:

Step 1: Update the existing packages
        sudo apt-get update
        
Step 2: Install Postfix using the command
        sudo apt install postfix
        
        i) Once the installation is done you will e directed to a pop up window in the terminal which asks for a domain name. 
           Enter the domain name and press enter
        ii) Then you will be directed to another pop-up, 
            select "Internet Site" and press OK
Now your domain name is set. In my case, the domain name is geethanjali.com

Step 3: We need to update the host name in the configuration file, to do that we need to 
         i) First open the the configuration file ,which exixts 
         in /etc/postfix directory with any text editor(nano, vim etc) of your choice 
        
            nano /etc/postfix/main.cf
         
         ii) Give the hostname in the file
            myhostname= 
            
         iii) Change the following fields to to below mentioned criteria
              
              inet_interfaces=loopback-only
               
              mydestination=$myhostname , geethanjali.com , localhost.singh.com , , localhost
              
              
Step 4: Open file /etc/hosts and add myhostname 
	
	127.0.0.1 localhost geethanjali.com
	127.0.1.1 geethanjali.com
If, this is already set, leave it as it is

Step 5: Define your email address on the system
      
        i) open /etc/aliases file
	
	   sudo nano /etc/aliases
	   
	   
	 ii) postmaster: root
	     root: your email id through which you want to send the mail to the receiver.
	     
Step 6: Set your mailname (the mail through which you want to send the email)
 
	  i)open and create mailname
	
	    sudo nano /etc/mailname
	
	  ii) add your mailname in the file
	
	
Step 7: Configure the smtp username and password

           i) We need to create a file named sasl_passwd and open it
           
              sudo nano /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
              
            ii)Then in the sasl_passwd file we need to add SMTP host ,username and the password . This password is the security key from the google account through which you will be sending mails. Get this in the security tab of your google account by enabling 2 step verification. Then the username will be the mail you will be using to send emails 
	
	       [smtp.gmail.com]:587 username:password
	       
Step 8: Create a hash file for postfix using postmap command

	        sudo postmap /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
	        
Step 9: The sasl_passwd file conatins the username and password ,so we will change the file ownership and permission to root by using the following commands
	
	sudo chown root:root /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd.db
	sudo chmod 0600 /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd.db
	
Step 10: Configure the relay host in the main.cf file as follows
         
         relayhost=[smtp.gmail.com]:587
         
Step 11: Then in the same file add the following configuration

          i)to enable SASL authentication
	smtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes
	
	  ii)to disallow methods that allow anonymous authentication.
	smtp_sasl_security_options = noanonymous
	
	  iii)to specify path to sasl_passwd file
	smtp_sasl_password_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
	
	   iv)To establish a secure and encrypted connection between mail servers ,we will enable STARTTLS(Secure Transport Layer Security) encryption
	smtp_use_tls = yes
	
	    v)to specify the path of CA certificates
	smtp_tls_CAfile = /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
	
Ensure to save all the files before exiting


Step 12: Enable and start postfix

	sudo systemctl enable postfix
  	sudo systemctl start postfix
  	
  	
Step 13: Send the mail to desired receiver

	echo "Body of the email" | mail -s "The subject line" email_address_of_receiver
