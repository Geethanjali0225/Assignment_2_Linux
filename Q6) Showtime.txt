Q6) Create a service with the name showtime , after starting the service, every minute it should print the current time in a file in the user home directory.

Soln:


Step 1: Create a script that will update the file with the current time. You can use a simple shell script for this purpose. Create a file named showtime.sh with the following content:


         sudo nano showtime.sh
         
         #!/bin/bash
while true; do
    date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S' > ~/showtime.txt
    sleep 60
done

This script continuously updates a file called showtime.txt in the user's home directory with the current date and time, and then sleeps for 60 seconds.


Step 2: Make the script executable by running the following command

        chmod +x showtime.sh

Step 3: Next, create a systemd service unit for the "showtime" service. Create a file named showtime.service in the /etc/systemd/system/ directory with the following content:

        [Unit]
        Description=Showtime Service
        After=network.target

        [Service]
        Type=simple
        ExecStart=/path/to/showtime.sh   #the path where your file named showtime.sh is saved

        [Install]
        WantedBy=multi-user.target
        
        
Step 4: Once the service unit file is created, reload systemd to make it aware of the new service

         sudo systemctl daemon-reload
         
Step 5: Now, you can start and enable the "showtime" service to make it run at boot and continuously update the file with the current time:


        sudo systemctl start showtime
        sudo systemctl enable showtime

Step 6: Once everything is done, stop the process by the following command

        sudo systemctl stop showtime
