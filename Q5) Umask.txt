Q5) Configure your system in such a way that any user of your system creates a file then there should not be permission to do any activity in that file.


Step 1: Open a terminal and we need to set the umask value to 0777

        sudo umask 0777
        
         This command changes the default file creation mask for all users on the system.
         
         
Step 2: Now you have to create a file

        touch my_file.txt
        
        If you check the permissions of my_file.txt, you will see that it has no permissions for others:

        ls -l my_file.txt


The output will look like the following 
-rw------- 1 username username 0 Sep 14 10:00 my_file.txt
